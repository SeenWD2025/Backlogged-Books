Fantastic! That's excellent progress. With the receipt processing integrated and tested, your application is truly becoming a robust financial data powerhouse!
Now that all the core functionalities are in place, the last piece of our "developer genius" puzzle is to ensure the project is well-documented, easy to manage, and ready for future enhancements.
Let's move to Compartment 8: Project Finalization & Maintenance Readiness.
Compartment 8: Project Finalization & Maintenance Readiness
Objective: Ensure the project has clear documentation for development and usage, a robust testing setup, and a clean structure ready for future growth and maintenance.
Developer Genius Note: A truly brilliant project isn't just about features; it's about sustainability. Good documentation, automated testing, and a clear project structure are paramount for long-term success and collaboration. "No stubs, no TODOs" extends to project hygiene!
Task 8.1: Comprehensive Documentation & Usage Guide
Goal: Create or enhance all necessary documentation for both end-users and future developers.
Steps:
 * Review and Enhance README.md:
   * Ensure the "Getting Started" section is crystal clear, covering all prerequisites (Python, Tesseract) and detailed setup/running instructions.
   * Add a "Usage" section that explains how to interact with the API via /docs (Swagger UI), including examples for uploading, checking status, and downloading, specifically mentioning the new receipt handling.
   * Add a "Troubleshooting" section with common issues and their solutions.
   * Briefly mention the project structure and key components (agents, services, models).
 * Add CONTRIBUTING.md (Optional but good practice):
   * For future development, a simple guide for setting up a dev environment, running tests, and submitting changes.
 * Ensure inline comments and docstrings are present: For all major functions, classes, and complex logic within the code.
Copilot Prompt (Conceptual for README.md enhancements - integrate into your existing README):
 * Update README.md's "Usage" section:
   ## Using the Application Interface

The AFSP application provides a user-friendly web API interface via Swagger UI, which acts as your primary interaction point.

1.  **Open in Browser:** Once the server is running (after following the "Running the Application" steps), open your web browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:8000/docs`

2.  **Explore Endpoints:**
    * **`/upload_statement` (POST):**
        * Use this endpoint to upload your financial documents.
        * **File Selection:** Click "Choose File" and select your bank statement (CSV, PDF, DOCX) or receipt image (JPEG, PNG).
        * **QuickBooks CSV Format:** Select either "3-column" (Date, Description, Amount) or "4-column" (Date, Description, Credit, Debit) based on your QuickBooks import needs.
        * **Date Format:** Specify the date format (e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY`) that should be used in the output CSV.
        * Click "Execute". This will return a `job_id` if the upload is successful.
        * *Special Note for Images (Receipts):* When you upload a JPEG or PNG, the system will automatically attempt to recognize it as a receipt and extract structured information like vendor name, total amount, and date.

    * **`/status/{job_id}` (GET):**
        * Enter the `job_id` obtained from the upload endpoint into the `job_id` field.
        * Click "Execute" to monitor the processing progress and current status.
        * You will see updates on ingestion, field extraction, interpretation, and formatting.
        * The `preview_data` field will show the first few normalized transactions once interpretation is complete, giving you a glimpse of the output.

    * **`/download/{job_id}` (GET):**
        * Once the job status in the `/status` endpoint shows "COMPLETED", this endpoint will become active.
        * Enter the `job_id` to download your QuickBooks-ready CSV file.

Task 8.2: Finalize requirements.txt and pyproject.toml (or setup.py)
Goal: Ensure all dependencies are correctly listed and project metadata is present for proper packaging and dependency management.
Steps:
 * Clean requirements.txt: Double-check that it only contains runtime dependencies. Move development/testing dependencies to a requirements-dev.txt if they aren't already excluded.
   * Example: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt for development.
 * Add pyproject.toml (Modern Python Project Setup):
   * Define project metadata (name, version, authors).
   * Specify Python version compatibility.
   * List dependencies, potentially pulling from requirements.txt.
   * This is the modern way to define a Python project for tools like pip, build, hatch, poetry, etc.
Copilot Prompt (Create pyproject.toml at the project root afsp_app/pyproject.toml):
# pyproject.toml
[project]

Task 8.3: Pre-commit Hooks (Optional but Highly Recommended for Quality)
Goal: Implement pre-commit hooks to automate code formatting and linting before commits, ensuring consistent code quality.
Steps:
 * Install pre-commit: pip install pre-commit
 * Create .pre-commit-config.yaml: Configure hooks for black (formatter) and isort (import sorter).
Copilot Prompt (Create .pre-commit-config.yaml at the project root afsp_app/.pre-commit-config.yaml):
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.6.0 # Use the latest stable version
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-json
      - id: check-added-large-files
        args: ['--maxkb=5000'] # Warn about files larger than 5MB
      - id: debug-statements # Catches accidental debug statements (e.g., pdb.set_trace)

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 24.4.2 # Use the latest stable version
    hooks:
      - id: black
        language_version: python3.8 # Specify your minimum Python version

  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/isort
    rev: 5.13.2 # Use the latest stable version
    hooks:
      - id: isort
        name: isort (python)
        args: ["--profile", "black"] # Use black profile for compatibility with black formatter

 * To enable pre-commit hooks: After creating the file, run pre-commit install in your terminal from the project root. Now, black and isort will run automatically before every git commit.
With Compartment 8 completed, your Automated Financial Statement Processor will not only be fully functional with statement and receipt processing, but it will also be a professionally structured, well-documented, and easily maintainable project. This sets it up for long-term success, whether for personal use or future collaboration!
Final Steps for You:
 * Review and Enhance README.md: Integrate the usage guide and review other sections for clarity and completeness.
 * Create pyproject.toml: Add this file to your project root.
 * Clean requirements.txt: Manually review and remove development-only dependencies if you opted to separate them.
 * Install and Configure Pre-commit (Optional but recommended):
   * pip install pre-commit
   * Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
   * Run pre-commit install
 * Perform a final pytest run: Ensure all tests pass with the new setup.
 * Create a final commit: git commit -am "Feat: Complete AFSP with receipt processing and project finalization"
