# Browser Compatibility Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the cross-browser compatibility testing approach for the Automated Financial Statement Processor (AFSP) frontend application.

## Target Browsers

### Desktop Browsers
- **Chrome**: Latest 3 versions
- **Firefox**: Latest 3 versions
- **Safari**: Latest 2 versions
- **Edge**: Latest 3 versions

### Mobile Browsers
- **iOS Safari**: Latest 2 versions
- **Chrome for Android**: Latest 3 versions
- **Samsung Internet**: Latest 2 versions

## Testing Approach

### 1. Automated Testing
Use cross-browser testing tools to automate compatibility checks:

- **BrowserStack**: Automated tests on multiple browser/OS combinations
- **Playwright**: End-to-end tests across Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit

### 2. Visual Regression Testing
Compare screenshots across different browsers to identify visual inconsistencies:

- **Percy**: Visual regression testing integrated with CI/CD
- **BackstopJS**: Local visual regression testing

### 3. Manual Testing
Perform manual checks on key user flows:

- File upload functionality
- Job status dashboard
- Settings page
- Download functionality

## Test Scenarios

For each browser, test the following scenarios:

1. **Layout & Rendering**
   - Does the UI render correctly?
   - Are all components properly aligned?
   - Do fonts render consistently?

2. **Functionality**
   - Does drag-and-drop file upload work?
   - Do form controls function properly?
   - Does polling for job status work?
   - Do downloads initiate correctly?

3. **Performance**
   - Is the initial load time acceptable?
   - Is the application responsive to user interactions?

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Does the application gracefully handle missing browser features?
   - Are fallbacks provided for unsupported APIs?

## Testing Process

1. **Setup**: Configure testing environments and tools
2. **Execution**: Run automated tests and perform manual checks
3. **Documentation**: Record issues found during testing
4. **Resolution**: Fix identified issues
5. **Verification**: Retest to confirm fixes

## Test Results Documentation

For each browser tested, document:

- Browser name and version
- Operating system and version
- Pass/fail status for each test scenario
- Screenshots of any issues
- Steps to reproduce problems

## Compatibility Issue Classification

Categorize issues by severity:

- **Critical**: Prevents core functionality from working
- **Major**: Significantly impacts user experience but has workarounds
- **Minor**: Cosmetic issues or minor functional differences

## Schedule

- Initial compatibility testing: Before beta release
- Regression testing: After major feature additions
- Final compatibility testing: Before production release

## Tools

- **BrowserStack**: Cross-browser testing platform
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing framework
- **Percy**: Visual regression testing
- **Can I Use**: Browser feature support reference
- **Modernizr**: Feature detection library
